## 🚀 Project Overview

This is the starter version of the app that simulates a X-like feed. It currently features:

- One hardcoded post rendered on page load
- A basic "New Post" form (not yet connected to backend or persistent storage)

## 🏗️ Technologies Used

- Python (Flask)
- HTML + JavaScript
- DOM manipulation using JS templates

6. Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## 🛠️ Next Steps
